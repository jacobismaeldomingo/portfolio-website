        With a strong foundation in computer science and hands-on experience in software development, 
        I am a dedicated and curious technologist passionate about solving complex problems through 
        innovative solutions. My journey has been shaped by a blend of academic rigor and real-world 
        applications, from developing analytical solutions at ESO to mentoring young coders at Code 
        Ninjas. I thrive in dynamic environments where I can continuously learn, adapt, and contribute 
        to impactful projects that push the boundaries of technology.

        Looking ahead, I am excited to further explore the intersection of software development, 
        cybersecurity, and web technologies. My goal is to leverage my technical expertise in 
        languages like Java, Python, and SQL, as well as frameworks such as ASP.NET Core and React, 
        to build scalable and secure systems. I am deeply committed to fostering collaboration, 
        driving innovation, and creating solutions that make a meaningful difference.
