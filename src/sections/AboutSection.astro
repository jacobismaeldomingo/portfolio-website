        With a strong foundation in computer science and hands-on experience in
        software development, I'm someone who enjoys working with computers and
        building things that solve real problems. I've learned a lot through my
        studies and hands-on experience, whether it's building software, helping
        improve systems at ESO, or teaching kids how to code at Code Ninjas. I
        like being part of projects where I can learn new things, work with
        others, and make a difference.

        Right now, I'm especially interested in how software, web, mobile
        development, and cybersecurity all come together. I want to keep growing
        my skills and use what I know to build tools and systems that are
        helpful, reliable, and safe. Working with others, being creative, and
        solving problems is what drives me.
